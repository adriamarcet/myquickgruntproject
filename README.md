# Quick grunt and bower project

The idea is to have a base project easy to install everywhere with all grunt files and dependencies up and running.

## Usage

For the moment, you will need to download this project either through git or gitlab portal or using command line: 

`git clone http://theurltothisprojecthere`

Once done you may go inside the _dev folder (or where the package.json file is located) for the project you have installed and run

`npm install -g bower`
`npm install -g grunt-cli`
`npm install`

After that hit

`bower install`

and hopefully all the magic happens and you can start developing hitting

`grunt`
